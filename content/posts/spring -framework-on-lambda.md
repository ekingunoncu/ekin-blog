Spring framework and Spring Boot are different things.

Even the repositories are distinct.

## [GitHub - spring-projects/spring-framework: Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)

### [This is the home of the Spring Framework: the foundation for all Spring projects. Collectively the Spring Framework and‚Ä¶](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)

## [GitHub - spring-projects/spring-boot: Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)

### [Spring Boot helps you to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss‚Ä¶](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)

We won‚Äôt cover what is what in this article but simply you can read descriptions of these repositories.

If you need Spring Boot on Lambda AWS already has a great starter project making use of the Maven archetypes.

I am not going to bother you with **blah blah blah** just check out the starter I created! I also wrote some comments for your better understanding.

- You will need sam-cli. *[What is sam-cli?](https://aws.amazon.com/tr/serverless/aws-sam/#:~:text=The%20AWS%20Serverless%20Application%20Model,and%20model%20it%20using%20YAML.)*
- You will need aws-cli and configure your IAM ACCESS and SECRET

```
aws configure set aws_access_key_id *o*o*o*o*o*o*o*o*o
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key *o*o*o*o*o*o*o*o*o
aws configure set default.region us-east-1
```

- How to build and deploy

```
MAVEN_OPTS="-DskipTests=true" sam build
sam deploy --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --s3-bucket ${DEPLOY_BUCKET} --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

or use shell scripts under the repository but don't forget to change your deploy bucket (an empty bucket to use for the deploy process)

```
sh sam-build.sh
sh sam-deploy.sh
```

And our Lambda Function just hatched üê£
